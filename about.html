            My name is Joseph Pogoretskiy. I was raised in the Shenandoah Valley and have lived here
            all my life. I grew up in a family of seven and I am currently a junior at James Madison
            University.<br /><br />
            I have always been fascinated with computers and technology ever since I was a little
            boy. I would be in awe of what tiny screens are able to do and would always beg my
            siblings to use their iPods. Watching them use their devices was even enough for me!

            I first picked up programming by teaching myself HTML and CSS through Codecademy in
            middle school STEM class. This was my first ever peek under the hood of a computer
            application.<br /><br />
            The earliest programming project I still have was a simple, static homepage for released
            music that I have been producing for about a decade on the side.

            I continued to learn front-end languages throughout the latter half of middle school and
            high school. I graduated Fort Defiance High School with a class rank of 8 and a Valley
            Scholars Scholarship.<br /><br />I go to James Madison University to study Computer
            Science full-time, where I am currently finishing up my Bachelor's degree. I have made

            Outside of academics, whenever I am not working, you will often find me reading books,
            watching YouTube, doing calisthenics, or socializing with friends.<br /><br />

            I enjoy being with my family, being active in my church through local activities and
            international mission trips, and working on personal project, whether that be
            programming applications or getting lost in church history.
