          <p class="about-me">
            My name is Joseph Pogoretskiy. I was raised in the Shenandoah Valley and have lived here
            all my life. I grew up in a family of seven and I am currently a junior at James Madison
            University.<br /><br />
            I have always been fascinated with computers and technology ever since I was a little
            boy. I would be in awe of what tiny screens are able to do and would always beg my
            siblings to use their iPods. Watching them use their devices was even enough for me!<br /><br />
            I first picked up programming by teaching myself HTML and CSS through Codecademy in
            middle school STEM class. This was my first ever peek under the hood of a computer
            application.
